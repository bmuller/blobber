/**
\mainpage Blobber :: The Blob Tracker
\section desc Description
Blobber is a program that tracks points of light (lasers, LEDs) and projects reactions.
Given a webcam, projector, and a computer, the idea is to track lights/colors with the camera and 
then project "reactions" onto a large surface with the projector. Right now, a framework has been 
created to allow the creation of modules to handle output "reactions" based on what the camera sees. 
These modules accept as input the pixel data from the camera and can draw on a Cairo::Context in a 
separate window (this method is called ~ 30 times/sec). Many modules can be loaded at once. You can 
also easily create your own modules.
